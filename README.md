### Setup

The code is using `pipenv` as a virtual environment and package manager. To run the code, all you need is to install the necessary dependencies. open the terminal and type:

- `git clone https://github.com/Khamies/Sequence-VAE.git` 
- `cd Sequence-VAE`
- `pipenv install`

And you should be ready to go to play with code and build upon it!

### Run the code

To train the model all you need is to type:

- `python main.py`

### Training

Here are the results from training the LSTM-VAE model:

- KL Loss

- Reconstruction loss

- KL loss vs Reconstruction loss

- ELBO loss

### Inference

#### 1. Sample Generation

Here is a generated sample from the model, when z ~ N(0,I) is given to the decoder.



#### 2. Interpolation

Here "President" word has been used as the start of the sentences. We randomly generated two sentences interpolated between them.

- Sentence 1: **President bush veto power changes meant to be a great number**

- Sentence 2: **President bush veto power opposed to the president of the house**

  

  **bush veto power opposed to the president of the house.**
